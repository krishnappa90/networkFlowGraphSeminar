Seminar from masters at the University of Paderborn. 

# Faster approximation of maximum flow in graphs using electrical
# flows and laplacian systems.

This is a literature research done on network flow algorithms, the research is very indepth and provides a great review on how the network flow algorithms can change the directions of research in real time. Please review the research paper attached in this repository.
